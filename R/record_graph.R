#' Record a Graph
#'
#' @description  This function captures a graph generated by the 'x' object and returns it as a recorded plot.
#'
#' @param x An object representing the graph to be recorded.
#'
#' @return A recorded plot of the graph generated by 'x'.

#' # Example 1: Record a scatter plot
#' data <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))
#' plot(data$x, data$y)
#' recorded_plot <- record_graph(1)

#' # Example 2: Record a bar plot
#' bar_data <- c(A = 10, B = 20, C = 15)
#' barplot(bar_data)
#' recorded_plot <- record_graph(2)
