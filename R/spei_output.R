#' Extract SPEI/SPI Column from 'spei' Object
#'
#' @description
#' 
#' This function extracts the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) or Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) column from a 'spei' object. It is designed to work with the original data and handle multiple stations if present. The function removes NA values introduced when unstacking the data to return a vector of the correct length.
#' 
# It requires the original data in order to return a vector of the correct length by removing NA values introduced when unstacking.
# An alternative to this is to have a single wrapper SPEI/SPI function to handle this.
# The advantage of this method is that it doesn't hide the call to SPEI/SPI in R-Instat and is compatible with the existing dialog.
# The wrapper function may be a prefered long-term solution.
#' 
#' @param x An object of class 'spei'.
#' @param data The data.frame to calculate from.
#' @param station The name of the station column in \code{data}, if the data are for multiple station.
#' @param year The name of the year column in \code{data}.
#' @param month The name of the month column in \code{data}.
#'
#' @return A vector containing the extracted SPEI/SPI column from the 'spei' object 'x'.
